                    The traditional methods of funding have made business capital harder to attain. Banks continue to face economic difficulties within their own sector, while venture capitals are very selective and call for a large minimum requirement in their investments.
                  </p><p>
                    By offering the business capital needed from the stepping stone (start-up phase), to acquiring more equpiment (growth phase), to financing franchises, <span class="text-primary"> CLC</span>'s services can be applied to every stage of an establishment. We also offer factoring (B2B) to assist with immediate needs that arise throughout regular business operations.

          <h3 class="blue">Media - Press Release</h3>
          <h3 class="blue">Corporate Lending Center - Reinventing the Commercial Financing Industry</h3>
          <p>
              Corporate Lending Center, Inc. is a commercial lending firm providing start-ups, small to mid-sized businesses and large corporations with financial capital to establish and grow their business. Along with being an outstanding community partner, it is bringing new jobs and opportunities to a well-deserving area. While helping entrepreneurial minds build their business propositions into global enterprises, CLC, Inc. will also be offering financial services to existing, established businesses to grow and develop to the next level.
          </p>
          <p>
              In the past, many have depended on banks to provide this type of assistance, but due to the recent economic state of the country, the difficulty of attaining financial funding has become a harsh reality.
          </p>
          <p>
              Standard and Poor's, a U.S based financial services company which provides research, analysis and credit ratings based on stocks and bonds, has lowered the U.S long-term rating. Looking at this type of economic instability, commercial banks and main-stream financial institutions are holding back capital to fund start-ups and small to midsized projects. This has created a limitation on new commercial loans for businesses currently seeking financing.
          </p>
          <p>
              Roger Mota, CEO of Corporate Lending Center, Inc., started this finance venture and has brought it to the forefront of his life's work. This new entity will give commercial financing an innovative way of funding small and large projects.  Instead of taking the traditional approach and focusing on an individual's credit report and history, CLC, Inc. will be evaluating eligibility on an individual's current business standing and the potential of the industry.
          </p>
          <p>
              "The potential of a brilliant idea cannot be judged solely by a number on a credit report; it takes passion, knowledge and a strong foundation to create something fundamental" states Roger Mota.
          </p>
          <p>
              CLC, Inc. will be providing commercial lending in various industries, such as, factoring (B2B), equipment leasing, merchant financing, vendor financing, franchise financing and many more. This venture is an attractive option for those seeking quick funding with fewer hassles to start a new business or expand an existing one.
          </p>
          <p>
              In recent years, there have been significant advances within the commercial finance industry. Reputable companies are now allowed to engage in commercial lending; providing flexible options along with helping maintain and strengthen the nation's economy. This enables the establishment and viability of small businesses. CLC, Inc. will offer a range of commercial financing for industries operating in retail, manufacturing, farming, construction, technological research, design and development and international business endeavors. This will include specialty areas such as healthcare (dental and medical), assisted living, restaurants, night clubs, and automotive amongst others.
          </p>
          <p>
              Our products include asset-based loans and enterprise value-based cash flow loans to support expansion, acquisition and growth.  An entrepreneur at heart, Roger speaks from experience, "our goal is not only to form collaborations where both parties benefit, but to also build long lasting relationships with our clients. We are assisting individuals to accelerate their ideas and existing businesses to reach greater heights while working to strengthen and revitalize the foundation of the American economy."
