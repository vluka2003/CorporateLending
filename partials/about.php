                <h3 class="text-primary">Corporate Lending Center, Inc.</h3> CLC, Inc is a privately owned financial firm created to deliver capital to individuals and businesses. Based in the Silicon Valley, our foundation is built on an extremely knowledgeable and qualified executive team.
              </p><p>
                We offer our clients strategic financing methods to build a strong base to continue expansion based on the industry potential and growth capabilities.

                By offering the business capital needed from the stepping stone (start-up phase), to acquiring more equpiment (growth phase), to financing franchises, <span class="text-primary"> CLC</span>'s services can be applied to every stage of an establishment. We also offer factoring (B2B) to assist with immediate needs that arise throughout regular business operations.
